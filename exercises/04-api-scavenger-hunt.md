# Exercise 4: API Scavenger Hunt (S14 homework)

Use the official docs, not a search engine summary:

- String: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html
- Math: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html

## 1. The String class
- Package it lives in:
- Number of constructors listed:

## 2. Four methods (return type and parameter list, exactly as the docs show)
| Method | Return type | Parameter list |
|---|---|---|
Here’s #2 filled in exactly like the Java docs:

| Method | Return type | Parameter list |
|---|---|---|
| `length` | `int` |input string |
| `isEmpty` | `boolean` | input string |
| `indexOf` (pick one version) | |  |
| `charAt` | `char` | ` |

If you want, I can also fill out #3 and #4 the same way.

## 3. A method with two or more signatures
Method name: contains("a" , "A")

Copy two of its signatures:

How do they differ? The first "a" is the string being replaced and the second is what it is being replaced with 

## 4. The Math class
Write the signature of each. Then say how many versions of `abs` there are.

- `abs`: input is number, int, double, float, long
- `pow`: input is 2 number, one is the base and the other number is the exponent
- `max`: input is 2 numbers
- Number of `abs` versions: 6

## 5. One String method we have not used
Method name: isBlank()
Returns true if the string is empty or contains only whute space codepoints, otherwise false.

Your code:
```java
String word = " ";
String word2 = "apple";

System.out.println(word.isBlank());
System.out.println(word2.isBlank());

Output:
```

True
False
